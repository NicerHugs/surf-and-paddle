surf-and-paddle
===============

A pixel perfect html/css replica of the sur-and-paddle.png file crreated for TIY.

To properly align the html over the .png:
Open the html in a chrome browser. Open the .png file with the pixel perfect chrome extension and set to  
position 0, 0. Increase the width of the browser window until the contents are centered and aligned. 
(the image was wider than my screen, so this was how I adjusted to ensure that centering the contents would 
result in proper alignment.)
